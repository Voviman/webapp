            <p>
                Experienced technology-oriented and data-driven marketing leader, with a focus on driving business through a ‘Brand + Demand’ marketing philosophy to increase inbound leads, develop pipelines and grow revenue in attributable, scalable ways.

                Currently I’m helping companies and organizations make meetings more productive as the CMO at Decisions.

                Previously led the digital acquisition marketing organization at Constant Contact, offering a powerful suite of digital marketing tools for small businesses and nonprofits.

                I also managed the paid and organic social media strategy and execution team at Monster.com, where we operated a Social Media Center focused on driving business results through deep social listening and engagement.

                Prior to Monster, I oversaw the redesign and redevelopment of the leading content sites at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, including the MIT News site (http://newsoffice.mit.edu) and MIT homepage.
