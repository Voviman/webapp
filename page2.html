                The Boston Globe is an American daily newspaper founded and based in Boston, Massachusetts. The newspaper has won a total of 26 Pulitzer Prizes, and had a weekday circulation of 92,820 during the final three months of 2019. The Boston Globe is the oldest and largest daily newspaper in Boston.<br>

                Founded in 1872, the paper was mainly controlled by Irish Catholic interests before being sold to Charles H. Taylor and his family. After being privately held until 1973, it was sold to The New York Times in 1993 for $1.1 billion, making it one of the most expensive print purchases in U.S. history.[4] The newspaper was purchased in 2013 by Boston Red Sox and Liverpool F.C. owner John W. Henry for $70 million from The New York Times Company, having lost over 90% of its value in 20 years.<br>

                The newspaper has been noted as "one of the nation's most prestigious papers." In 1967, The Boston Globe became the first major paper in the U.S. to come out against the Vietnam War. The paper's 2002 coverage of the Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal received international media attention and served as the basis for the 2015 American drama film Spotlight.<br>

                The chief print rival of The Boston Globe is the Boston Herald, which has a smaller circulation that is declining more rapidly. The editor of The Boston Globe is Brian McGrory, who took the helm in December 2012.<br>

                Under the helm of editor Martin Baron and then Brian McGrory, the Globe shifted away from coverage of international news in favor of Boston-area news. Globe reporters Michael Rezendes, Matt Carroll, Sacha Pfeiffer and Walter Robinson and editor Ben Bradlee Jr. were an instrumental part of uncovering the Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal in 2001–2003, especially in relation to Massachusetts churches. They were awarded the Pulitzer Prize for their work, one of several the paper has received for its investigative journalism, and their work was dramatized in the 2015 Academy Award-winning film Spotlight, named after the paper's in-depth investigative division.
